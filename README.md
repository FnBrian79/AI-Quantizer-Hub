# 🌌 AI Quantizer Hub

### *Sovereign Local-First AI Orchestration & Forensic Sanctuary*

**AI Quantizer Hub** is a local-first system for orchestrating AI workflows across personal hardware and optional cloud infrastructure. It emphasizes reproducibility, provenance, and operator-controlled governance.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **🌉 Sovereign Bridge:** SSH-based orchestration between mobile and workstation nodes for low-friction, auditable control.
* **⚖️ Evidence-Oriented Data Processing:** Transforms large personal archives (e.g., exports from common cloud platforms) into structured local stores (such as SQLite) with hashing, manifests, and reproducible transforms to support provenance-aware analysis.
* **🛡️ Constitutional Governance:** Documents authority boundaries and operational rules (human operator ratification; delegated agent execution under scope).
* **🔐 Encrypted Local Secrets:** Keeps credentials local with encryption at rest and environment-based injection (implementation documented in-repo).
* **📦 Quantization & VRAM-Aware Execution:** Tooling to fit models within local GPU constraints and maintain stable inference under load.

## 🏗️ Technical Stack

* **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
* **Local Backbone:** Ollama (local) + Python services (where applicable)
* **Database:** SQLite for local ledgers/manifests

## 🛠️ Quick Start
