# Palette's Journal

## 2025-05-18 - [Initial Setup]
**Learning:** This repo lacks a consistent journal for UX learnings.
**Action:** Created this file to track future UX/a11y insights.

## 2025-05-18 - [Manual Neural Injection Interaction]
**Learning:** Decorative inputs confuse users by promising interaction that doesn't exist. This "Manual Neural Injection" input was purely visual.
**Action:** Connected the input to the system log, added ARIA labels, and keyboard support. Now it feels like a real terminal tool, matching the "hacker" aesthetic while being accessible.
